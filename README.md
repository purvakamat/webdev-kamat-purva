## About Me:    
I am a candidate for Masters in Computer Science at Northeastern University pursuing my degree with a concentration in Artificial Intelligence. I have previously worked full-time with 2 software companies, developing mobile and desktop applications. The applications I worked on were targeted towards platforms like Symbian (Qt framework), Windows Phone (.Net Silverlight) & Windows Desktop (.Net WPF). Currently I work as a Masters Assistant for the Object Oriented Design course at the CCIS department in Northeastern. During Summer 2017, I interned with VMware as a SDDC Engineer Intern. My responsibility was to develop Project Canvas, a web based SDDC design tool to guide customers & PSOs through several design decisions that make up the VMware Validated Design. Canvas was designed using MEAN stack and Clarity UI and was hosted using Pivotal Cloud Foundry.
